# PHPForge Engineering Instructions

## Engineering Scope And Decision Rules

### Core Policy And Change Discipline

- Stay framework-agnostic unless the project clearly requires otherwise.
- Treat correctness, security, data integrity and operational stability as non-negotiable constraints.
- The primary performance objective is the highest sustainable number of successful requests per minute (`RPM`) on production-equivalent infrastructure.
- Among correct, secure and stable implementations, choose the implementation with the highest measured sustained throughput.
- Optimize the complete execution path rather than isolated syntax, minimum resource usage or architectural fashion.
- Prefer simple, explicit and measurable solutions.
- Avoid speculative architecture, unnecessary abstractions and unnecessary layers.
- Follow project conventions unless they conflict with correctness, security, throughput or a clearly better design.
- Use modern PHP, strict typing and clear contracts.
- Apply accepted PHP-FIG PSRs at genuine interoperability boundaries where providers and consumers benefit from a shared contract.
- Apply the project's declared major version of relevant PHP Evolving Recommendations (`PERs`) where their guidance fits.
- Do not introduce a PSR interface, implementation package, adapter or conversion merely because a standard exists.
- Keep interoperability adaptation at boundaries and preserve the simplest efficient internal representation.
- When a PSR-compliant and project-specific design provide equivalent behavior and sustained RPM, prefer the interoperable PSR contract.
- Apply `SOLID` pragmatically. Prefer composition over inheritance only when it creates a real contract, substitution boundary or reduction in total complexity.
- Be skeptical of defaults, conventions and abstractions that introduce hidden runtime or operational costs.
- When sustained throughput is practically equivalent, choose the implementation with lower complexity, lower operating cost and more predictable behavior.
- When uncertain, choose the simpler design that is easier to benchmark, profile, operate and change.

- Focus on the active task and implement the smallest correct change set.
- Do not perform broad cleanup, refactoring, renaming, file moves, dependency changes or rewrites without explicit approval.
- Do not change behavior outside the requested scope unless required for correctness, security, compatibility or stability.
- Preserve public contracts unless a breaking change is explicitly approved.
- Do not introduce infrastructure, dependencies, patterns or abstractions for hypothetical future requirements.
- Separate required changes from optional improvements.
- Make meaningful trade-offs explicit.
- Do not hide unrelated refactoring inside feature or bug-fix work.

### Universal Applicability

- Apply these instructions to all first-party PHP code, including:
  - applications,
  - frameworks,
  - libraries,
  - SDKs,
  - packages,
  - command-line tools,
  - workers,
  - database abstractions,
  - query builders,
  - cache clients,
  - authentication components,
  - OTP and cryptographic libraries,
  - serializers,
  - middleware,
  - adapters,
  - and infrastructure utilities.
- Assume any reusable PHP component may eventually execute inside a high-volume request-response lifecycle.
- Design every package so it contributes the least practical overhead to the host application's sustained successful RPM.
- Do not treat code as performance-insensitive merely because it does not directly serve HTTP requests.
- A component may execute:
  - once during bootstrap,
  - once per request,
  - several times per request,
  - once per database row,
  - inside a hot loop,
  - inside a worker,
  - or inside a persistent application server.
- Evaluate cost according to expected call frequency and placement in the complete execution path.
- For reusable libraries, isolated calls per second are a supporting metric; the primary metric remains the effect on representative host-application RPM.
- Do not claim application-level throughput from a component-only microbenchmark.
- Avoid framework-specific assumptions unless the package explicitly targets that framework.
- Keep reusable code safe for normal PHP-FPM execution and persistent-worker runtimes where practical.
- Do not retain request-specific, tenant-specific or user-specific state in static or long-lived objects unless the lifecycle is explicit and safely reset.
- Keep package bootstrap deterministic, minimal and free from unnecessary I/O.
- Avoid automatic filesystem scanning, network access, environment parsing, reflection discovery or service registration during package loading.
- Do not perform work at file-include time beyond declarations and immutable compile-time-safe setup.
- Defer optional work until it is actually required.
- Keep dependencies minimal and justify each dependency by substantial functional or measured throughput value.
- Preserve a short, direct common path for the most frequently used operations.
- Keep optional diagnostics, tracing and logging disabled by default unless required by the contract.
- Expose observability hooks without imposing expensive work on users who do not enable them.
- Benchmark realistic repeated invocation for packages that may run inside loops or row processing.
- Benchmark cold and warm loading for packages used during bootstrap.
- Soak-test repeated execution and state reset for packages intended for persistent workers.

## Performance Objective, Measurement And Acceptance

### Sustained Throughput Objective

- The primary performance metric is sustained successful requests per minute (`RPM`).
- Use successful requests per second (`RPS`) when convenient and convert consistently:

  `RPM = RPS × 60`

- Count only complete, correct and valid responses as successful throughput.
- Do not count failed, timed-out, partial, invalid, incorrectly authorized or incorrectly cached responses as successful throughput.
- Optimize for the highest stable RPM the complete system can sustain on production-equivalent hardware.
- Resource efficiency, minimum latency for one isolated request, minimum allocation count, minimum file count and architectural elegance are secondary to sustained successful RPM.
- Accept additional CPU, memory, caching, precomputation, indexing, duplication, persistent workers or process capacity when they materially increase sustained successful RPM.
- Do not reject a higher-throughput implementation merely because it uses moderately more CPU or memory.
- Keep every resource-for-throughput trade bounded by explicit limits such as:
  - request memory,
  - worker memory,
  - cache size,
  - process count,
  - connection count,
  - concurrency,
  - queue depth,
  - payload size,
  - execution timeout,
  - database capacity,
  - and downstream rate limits.
- Do not accept a single-request latency improvement that lowers total sustained RPM.
- Do not accept a short burst result when queues, memory, errors, timeouts or downstream pressure continue growing.
- Sustainable throughput requires:
  - stable queue depth,
  - bounded memory,
  - bounded connection usage,
  - acceptable error and timeout rates,
  - correct responses,
  - and no progressive degradation during the benchmark period.
- Prefer the implementation that produces the highest median sustained successful RPM across repeated representative runs.
- When two implementations provide practically equivalent RPM, choose the one with lower complexity, lower operating cost and safer operations.
- Do not require a dedicated benchmark for every trivial, semantically equivalent reduction in work.
- Require representative measurement for architectural changes, hot paths, repeated operations and changes likely to affect request throughput.

### Application And Library Throughput

- Optimize library APIs for repeated use, not only one isolated invocation.
- Keep common operations allocation-conscious and avoid unnecessary object graphs, wrappers and conversions.
- Avoid hidden initialization on the first business call when initialization can be performed explicitly or amortized safely.
- Reuse immutable validated configuration instead of reparsing or renormalizing it on every call.
- Do not cache caller-specific, tenant-specific, secret or mutable values across requests unless safely scoped and explicitly supported.
- Accept deploy-varying configuration and attached resources from the caller instead of discovering them implicitly, unless discovery is the package's explicit responsibility.
- Benchmark:
  - first call,
  - warm repeated calls,
  - valid input,
  - invalid input,
  - failure paths,
  - large input,
  - and repeated calls inside one request.
- Report both isolated component throughput and representative end-to-end request throughput.
- Reject an isolated optimization when integration overhead lowers complete application RPM.

### Performance Measurement

- Measure before and after every meaningful performance-sensitive change.
- Establish a reproducible production-equivalent RPM baseline before optimization.
- The primary result is sustained successful `RPM`; also record `RPS`.
- Measure complete end-to-end requests rather than only isolated functions.
- Confirm every benchmark candidate returns equivalent correct output.
- Run benchmarks at several concurrency levels to produce a throughput curve.
- Identify:
  - the concurrency where throughput begins to rise,
  - the concurrency where peak sustained RPM is reached,
  - and the point where queueing, errors or timeouts begin to dominate.
- Benchmark long enough to reach steady state and expose:
  - worker saturation,
  - CPU throttling,
  - connection exhaustion,
  - cache churn,
  - memory growth,
  - allocator pressure,
  - and queue accumulation.
- Warm OPcache, Composer metadata, generated configuration and relevant application caches before measuring warm-state production throughput.
- Measure cold-start behavior separately when restarts, deployments or autoscaling are operationally frequent.
- Measure lazy first-use cost separately from warm memoized or reused execution.
- Include representative optional-feature usage so eager and lazy strategies are compared against the real request mix.
- Use multiple runs and compare median sustained successful RPM.
- Record variance and reject conclusions when the difference is within normal measurement noise.
- Confirm the load generator, client CPU and network path are not the bottleneck.
- Distribute load generation across multiple clients when one client cannot saturate the server reliably.
- Record at minimum:
  - successful `RPS`,
  - successful `RPM`,
  - total completed requests,
  - failed requests,
  - timeout rate,
  - response-validation failures,
  - benchmark duration,
  - concurrency,
  - `p50`, `p95` and `p99` latency,
  - CPU utilization,
  - peak and steady-state memory,
  - PHP worker utilization,
  - queue depth,
  - database connections,
  - query count,
  - cache hit rate,
  - and external-service calls.
- Measure the complete production-like stack, including:
  - web server,
  - PHP runtime,
  - OPcache,
  - bootstrap,
  - application or library code,
  - database,
  - cache,
  - serialization,
  - authentication,
  - authorization,
  - and required external dependencies.
- Use microbenchmarks only to investigate a known hot operation.
- Do not use a microbenchmark as proof that complete request RPM improved.
- Control PHP version, extensions, OPcache settings, Composer mode, hardware, operating system, database state and datasets.
- Disable Xdebug and non-production debugging extensions unless measuring their intentional production use.
- Record benchmark commands, configuration and environment details so results can be reproduced.
- Test scaling behavior across representative input sizes and data distributions.
- Include expected failure, miss and retry paths when they materially affect production traffic.
- Do not claim a throughput improvement from a single run, short burst or invalid response.

**Benchmark Diagnostics**

- When several benchmark phases run in one PHP process, use `memory_reset_peak_usage()` where supported to isolate phase-specific peak-memory measurements.
- Do not call memory-measurement functions in ordinary hot request paths unless production telemetry explicitly requires them.
- On supported CLI runtimes, capture non-default INI settings with `php --ini=diff` as part of benchmark and incident evidence.
- Include extension versions and relevant native-client versions in benchmark records.

### Required Benchmark Coverage

- Maintain separate production-equivalent benchmarks for workload classes relevant to the project.
- Include, where applicable:
  - minimal bootstrap and routing,
  - plain or minimal response,
  - JSON serialization,
  - cached read,
  - cache miss and fill,
  - single database read,
  - multi-row database read,
  - database write transaction,
  - authenticated request,
  - authorization-heavy request,
  - validation-heavy request,
  - non-cryptographic hashing,
  - cryptographic digest generation,
  - HMAC generation and verification,
  - OTP generation,
  - OTP verification,
  - external-service request,
  - large response or export,
  - file upload,
  - repeated library calls inside one request,
  - lazy first-use initialization,
  - eager startup initialization,
  - batched or prefetched relation loading,
  - lazy streaming or cursor consumption,
  - and background-job processing.
- Do not extrapolate application RPM from a Hello World benchmark.
- Use minimal-response benchmarks to identify bootstrap, routing and framework overhead.
- Use representative business-route benchmarks to identify database, cache, serialization, authentication, validation and integration costs.
- Weight benchmark scenarios according to actual or expected traffic distribution.
- Optimize scenarios that dominate total production request volume.
- Keep benchmark fixtures deterministic and large enough to expose realistic query, allocation and memory behavior.

### Optimization And Acceptance Rules

- Optimize algorithms, query count, I/O, allocations, copying, serialization and data movement before cosmetic syntax.
- Apply low-risk, semantically equivalent reductions in work without requiring a benchmark for every occurrence.
- Prefer `isset()` over `array_key_exists()` when null and missing are intentionally equivalent.
- Prefer direct access and one-pass processing over callback-heavy pipelines that create avoidable intermediate arrays on hot or large datasets.
- Prefer reuse of an already computed value when recomputation is non-trivial and the cached value has a clear bounded lifetime.
- Do not add caching, indexes or precomputation when their construction, allocation and invalidation cost is likely to exceed reuse.
- Treat generic PHP microbenchmarks as evidence, not universal law. Confirm important decisions on the project's PHP version and representative workload.
- Do not change semantics merely to use a faster-looking construct.
- Do not assume meaningful gains from trivial stylistic choices such as:
  - pre-increment versus post-increment when the result is unused,
  - single quotes versus double quotes without interpolation,
  - `echo` versus `print`,
  - or formatting differences.
- Do consider function-call, callback, allocation and intermediate-array overhead in code executed millions of times or across very large datasets.
- Avoid clever bit-level, branchless or manual-inlining tricks unless the path is demonstrably hot and the result is clearer or measurably faster.
- Never weaken validation, authorization, escaping, type safety, error handling or cryptographic security for speed.
- Avoid repeated defensive checks after a value has already been validated and converted at a trusted boundary, unless the contract permits mutation or another trust boundary is crossed.
- Document non-obvious performance code with the reason, evidence and constraints that justify it.
- Revert an optimization when its measured benefit is insignificant or its complexity creates a greater maintenance or correctness risk.

- Treat these instructions as engineering guardrails; only representative measurements prove that an implementation is performant.
- The primary acceptance metric is median sustained successful requests per minute (`RPM`) across repeated production-equivalent runs.
- Count only complete, correct, authorized and valid responses as successful throughput.
- Define measurable performance budgets for each important:
  - request path,
  - command,
  - worker,
  - batch workflow,
  - background job,
  - and reusable library operation.
- Do not use one universal RPM, latency, memory, query-count or throughput target for unrelated workloads.
- Define workload-specific limits such as:

```yaml
throughput_budget:
    successful_rpm_min: <baseline-or-target>
    max_rpm_regression_percent: 2
    max_error_rate_percent: <project-limit>
    max_timeout_rate_percent: <project-limit>
    max_p99_latency_ms: <safety-limit>
    max_peak_memory_mb: <capacity-limit>
    max_queue_growth: 0
```

- Establish a production-representative baseline before changing a performance-sensitive path.
- Validate performance against representative:
  - data volume,
  - data distribution,
  - concurrency,
  - request mix,
  - repeated call frequency,
  - dependency latency,
  - cache-hit and cache-miss states,
  - database state,
  - success paths,
  - failure paths,
  - and retry behavior.
- Measure complete end-to-end behavior in addition to isolated functions or library calls.
- For reusable libraries, measure both:
  - isolated operation throughput,
  - and the effect on representative host-application RPM.
- Do not claim application-level throughput from a component-only microbenchmark.
- Track at minimum where relevant:
  - successful `RPS`,
  - successful `RPM`,
  - total completed requests,
  - failed requests,
  - error rate,
  - timeout rate,
  - response-validation failures,
  - benchmark duration,
  - concurrency,
  - `p50`, `p95` and `p99` latency,
  - CPU utilization,
  - peak and steady-state memory,
  - allocation or memory-growth rate,
  - worker utilization,
  - queue depth and queue growth,
  - query count,
  - rows examined and returned,
  - lock duration,
  - transaction duration,
  - database connection usage,
  - external calls and dependency latency,
  - and cache hit rate.
- Add automated performance-regression checks only where the workload and environment are stable enough to produce a reliable signal.
- Define an acceptable regression tolerance for each benchmark.
- For stable, business-critical benchmarks, use a default maximum tolerated median RPM regression of `2%` unless measured variance requires a different threshold.
- Do not fail builds for differences that remain within established benchmark variance.
- Treat a material sustained RPM regression as a blocking defect unless explicitly approved.
- Do not approve a change merely because it reduces:
  - CPU,
  - memory,
  - allocations,
  - file count,
  - object count,
  - or single-request latency
  when sustained successful RPM decreases.
- Do not approve higher RPM when:
  - output correctness differs,
  - authorization or validation is bypassed,
  - data integrity changes,
  - security protections are reduced,
  - error or timeout rates exceed their budgets,
  - queue depth grows continuously,
  - memory grows without bound,
  - workers or connections are exhausted,
  - or downstream systems become unstable.
- Treat `p95` and `p99` latency as safety constraints rather than the primary optimization target.
- A latency increase may be accepted when sustained RPM materially improves and latency remains within the defined safety budget.
- Do not accept a short-burst throughput increase when steady-state RPM is lower or the system progressively degrades.
- Use static analysis to enforce structural rules, but never treat static-analysis success as performance validation.
- Use query-plan analysis for important database paths.
- Use load testing for concurrency-sensitive and capacity-sensitive paths.
- Use soak testing for:
  - persistent workers,
  - consumers,
  - daemons,
  - repeated library execution,
  - and processes where memory growth or resource leakage is possible.
- Compare cold-start and warm-runtime performance separately.
- Use warm-state sustained RPM as the primary production metric unless cold starts are operationally frequent.
- Test with the same:
  - PHP major and minor version,
  - extensions,
  - Composer mode,
  - OPcache configuration,
  - runtime model,
  - operating system,
  - hardware class,
  - database configuration,
  - cache configuration,
  - and relevant infrastructure
  used in production.
- Confirm that the load generator, client CPU and network path are not the benchmark bottleneck.
- Record benchmark and load-test commands, configuration and environment details so results can be reproduced.
- Verify critical throughput and stability metrics after deployment through production telemetry or a controlled production-like canary.
- Define rollback or mitigation criteria for:
  - RPM regression,
  - error-rate increase,
  - timeout increase,
  - unacceptable `p99` latency,
  - unbounded queue growth,
  - memory growth,
  - worker exhaustion,
  - database saturation,
  - cache instability,
  - and downstream overload.
- Review performance budgets as traffic, call frequency, data volume, hardware, runtime and business requirements change.
- Optimize the dominant measured bottleneck rather than attempting to apply every possible optimization.
- Require explicit review before adding the following across hot or frequently called paths:
  - middleware,
  - wrappers,
  - object-conversion layers,
  - reflection,
  - dynamic discovery,
  - repeated validation,
  - synchronous logging,
  - additional database calls,
  - additional serialization passes,
  - broad `unset()` calls,
  - helper dispatch,
  - or additional bootstrap work.
- Do not approve automated bulk transformations affecting hot paths without representative before-and-after RPM measurements.
- Treat large elapsed-time or RPM regressions as blocking defects even when formatting, static analysis, style checks and unit tests pass.
- Prefer the highest justified sustainable successful RPM over theoretical, short-lived or benchmark-only speed.
- Treat resource growth as acceptable when it produces a material RPM improvement and remains within explicit stability and capacity budgets.
- Never trade correctness, security, authorization, data integrity or operational stability for benchmark throughput.

## Runtime Compatibility, Standards And Public Contracts

### Runtime Support And Upgrade Policy

- Treat the selected PHP version, enabled extensions, build type and important INI settings as part of the executable contract.
- Run production workloads on an actively supported PHP branch and keep current with compatible patch releases.
- Use an unsupported branch only through a documented exception with compensating controls and an upgrade deadline.
- Declare the minimum supported PHP version and required `ext-*` extensions in Composer where practical.
- Test against real supported runtimes; do not rely only on Composer platform emulation.
- Keep `config.platform.php`, when used, aligned with production and verify the actual runtime separately.
- For reusable packages:
  - maintain a supported-version matrix,
  - test the lowest supported version,
  - test the primary production version,
  - and test the next intended upgrade target where reliable.
- Review migration guides, deprecations, removed features, extension changes and default-value changes before each minor-version upgrade.
- Run tests with `E_ALL` and capture deprecations in CI or a dedicated compatibility job.
- Treat deprecations as migration work rather than production noise to suppress indefinitely.
- Resolve feature availability once during build, startup or bootstrap.
- Avoid repeated `PHP_VERSION_ID`, `version_compare()`, `function_exists()`, `class_exists()` or extension checks in hot paths.
- Select the compatible implementation once and reuse it.
- Do not add a user-land polyfill when the minimum supported runtime already provides the native API.
- When a polyfill is required:
  - isolate it from business code,
  - preserve native semantics,
  - avoid future global-symbol conflicts,
  - and benchmark it when used in a hot path.
- Treat a PHP runtime upgrade as a performance experiment:
  - rerun representative RPM benchmarks,
  - compare memory use and worker density,
  - verify OPcache and JIT behavior,
  - and verify extension, database and serialization compatibility.
- Record the exact PHP version, extension versions, build type and relevant INI values with every benchmark result.

### Public API And Language Compatibility

- Treat public function and method parameter names as compatibility-sensitive because callers may use named arguments.
- Do not rename public parameters in a backward-compatible release unless named-argument compatibility is explicitly excluded.
- Declare properties explicitly and do not rely on dynamic properties.
- Use `stdClass`, documented associative structures or `#[\AllowDynamicProperties]` only when open-ended fields are intentional.
- Prefer explicit nullable types such as `?Type` or `Type|null`; do not rely on implicitly nullable parameters.
- Use typed class constants when supported and when they strengthen a public or inheritance contract.
- Use `#[\Override]` where supported to detect accidental overriding-contract drift.
- Use `#[\Deprecated]` for intentionally deprecated public APIs where supported.
- Pair each deprecation with:
  - a replacement,
  - a migration message,
  - a version or removal timeline,
  - and compatibility tests.
- Use `#[\NoDiscard]` when ignoring a return value is likely to hide a correctness failure.
- Apply `#[\NoDiscard]` to the concrete callable that is actually invoked.
- Use `#[\SensitiveParameter]` on secret-bearing parameters where supported.
- Do not treat attribute-based redaction as a replacement for safe logging and exception handling.
- Use readonly classes, readonly properties, asymmetric visibility and property hooks only when they enforce a useful contract.
- Do not introduce property hooks, lazy objects, attributes or reflection as presumed performance optimizations.

### Coding Style And File Basics

- Follow PSR-1 for basic code interoperability.
- For new or intentionally reformatted code, follow the project-declared major version of PER Coding Style.
- Prefer the latest approved PER Coding Style major version supported by the project's PHP baseline.
- Keep an established repository style unless a style migration is explicitly approved.
- Do not create a repository-wide formatting diff as part of an unrelated feature or bug fix.
- Enforce coding style with a deterministic formatter and CI rather than subjective review.
- Pin the selected coding-style major version in project documentation or tooling.
- Use UTF-8 without a byte-order mark.
- Use Unix `LF` line endings.
- End PHP files with a single newline.
- Omit the closing `?>` tag from PHP-only files.
- A PHP file should normally either declare symbols or perform side effects, but not both.
- Keep bootstrap and executable side effects in explicit entry-point or configuration files.
- Use one statement per line.
- Use four spaces for indentation and do not use tabs for indentation.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.
- Apply style rules for newer syntax only when that syntax exists in the supported PHP versions.
- Do not use deprecated PSR-2 as the coding-style target for new code.
- Retain PSR-12 only where an established project or toolchain still requires it; prefer PER Coding Style for current PHP syntax.

### PHP-FIG Standards Selection And Status

- Treat accepted PSRs as stable interoperability contracts.
- Treat PERs as versioned recommendations that may evolve; pin the intended major version.
- Do not make Draft or Review specifications mandatory project requirements without explicit approval and risk assessment.
- Do not present Abandoned proposals as PHP-FIG standards.
- Do not choose Deprecated standards for new code.
- Use PSR-4 instead of deprecated PSR-0.
- Use PER Coding Style for current new code instead of deprecated PSR-2.
- Preserve an older accepted contract only when compatibility with existing consumers requires it.
- Review the official status and current package versions before adding a new PHP-FIG dependency.
- Document which PSRs and PER versions form part of the public package or application contract.
- Do not advertise PHP-FIG compliance unless the relevant normative requirements and compatibility tests are satisfied.

## Types, Validation And Control Flow

### Type Safety And Data Boundaries

- Add `declare(strict_types=1);` to first-party PHP files unless project compatibility explicitly prevents it.
- Prefer strict comparisons (`===`, `!==`) by default.
- Do not rely on implicit type coercion.
- Normalize and validate external values at system boundaries.
- Do not pass unvalidated request, environment, database, message or file data directly into domain logic.
- Use explicit parameter, property and return types wherever practical.
- Prefer narrow, precise types over `mixed`, generic arrays and undocumented structures.
- Use enums or explicit value objects for finite states when they materially improve correctness.
- Use strict comparison modes where available:

```php
in_array($value, $items, true);
array_search($value, $items, true);
```

- Avoid ambiguous truthiness checks involving `0`, `"0"`, `""`, `false` and `null`.
- Compare against the intended state explicitly.
- Distinguish between:
  - missing,
  - empty,
  - false,
  - zero,
  - null,
  - and invalid values.
- Prefer `isset($array[$key])` for array-key existence, lookup guards and set-membership checks whenever a missing key and a `null` value are intentionally equivalent.
- Treat `isset()` as the default hot-path key check when its null semantics are correct.
- Use `array_key_exists()` only when the code must distinguish a present key containing `null` from a missing key.
- For null-insensitive nested existence checks, prefer direct `isset($data['parent']['child'])` access instead of multiple key checks.
- Do not call both `isset()` and `array_key_exists()` for the same key unless the null distinction is functionally required.
- Use `empty()` only when all PHP empty values are intentionally equivalent. Prefer explicit comparisons when `0`, `"0"`, `false`, `""` and `null` have different meanings.
- Validate and normalize untrusted data once at the trust boundary, then pass a typed or documented internal representation onward.
- Do not repeat identical validation, normalization or conversion at every internal layer or loop unless the value can change or crosses another trust boundary.
- Do not use null coalescing or null-safe access to conceal missing validation.
- Avoid undocumented sentinel values.
- Introduce result objects, enums or exceptions only when they improve a real contract. Do not wrap simple hot-path scalar or array results merely to add abstraction.

### Control Flow, Branching And Exceptions

- Use guard clauses and early returns to keep the primary execution path clear.
- Avoid deep nesting.
- Avoid unnecessary `else` branches after `return`, `throw`, `continue` or `break`.
- Avoid long `if` / `elseif` chains.
- Consider an exhaustive `match`, lookup map, enum method or dedicated handler when it makes dispatch clearer.
- Prefer `match` for finite value dispatch when strict comparison, exhaustiveness and lack of fall-through are desirable.
- Avoid a default `match` arm when explicitly handling every supported state provides better safety.
- Do not introduce handler classes or strategy hierarchies merely to eliminate a small conditional.
- Prefer the least complex control-flow structure that remains clear and extensible.
- Keep boolean expressions readable.
- Extract complex predicates into clearly named methods when the name communicates intent better than the expression.
- Avoid boolean parameters that substantially change a method’s behavior.
- Prefer separate operations, enums or explicit options when behavior diverges significantly.
- Do not use exceptions for normal expected branching.
- Use exceptions for failures that interrupt the normal contract and cannot be handled meaningfully at the current level.

## Classes, Methods, Files And Abstraction

### Cohesion, Size And Complexity

- Keep methods, functions and closures small, cohesive and clear.
- Split code when responsibilities, branch count or execution paths become difficult to reason about.
- Avoid hidden side effects and mixed responsibilities.
- Make state changes explicit.
- Prefer immutable values where mutation is unnecessary.
- Avoid unnecessary inheritance hierarchies, wrappers, service layers, factories and indirection.
- Prefer deterministic functions for transformations and calculations.
- Avoid global mutable state.
- Treat static mutable state carefully, especially in long-running workers and application servers.
- Keep dependencies explicit.
- Avoid service locators and hidden dependency resolution.
- Add docblocks only when they communicate information PHP types cannot express clearly.
- Do not add docblocks that merely repeat method names or native type declarations.
- Do not use references as a presumed optimization.
- Use references only when reference semantics are functionally required.
- Do not extract every small block into another method. Keep cohesive low-level operations local when extraction would add dispatch without improving reuse, testing, invariants or readability.
- Avoid chains of tiny method calls inside measured hot loops when equivalent local code is clearer and materially faster.
- Do not introduce DTOs, value objects, wrappers or custom collections into a hot path solely for stylistic consistency when they add allocations without enforcing a useful contract.

Use the following default limits:

```yaml
cognitive_complexity:
    class: 80
    function: 12
    dependency_tree: 120
```

- Treat cognitive complexity as a maintainability guard, not a runtime-performance target.
- Do not increase complexity thresholds to pursue theoretical performance improvements.
- Prefer simplifying control flow before extracting additional methods or classes.
- Do not fragment cohesive hot-path logic into excessive wrappers solely to satisfy a complexity limit.
- Do not raise a project-wide limit to accommodate one parser, protocol implementation, state machine, generated file or performance-critical algorithm.
- Allow narrowly scoped exceptions only when profiling and representative benchmarks show that the simpler refactoring causes a material regression.
- Document every exception with:
  - the affected hot path,
  - profiler or benchmark evidence,
  - the tested workload,
  - why the complexity is necessary,
  - and when the exception should be reviewed.
- Exclude generated code from cognitive-complexity enforcement where appropriate.
- Configure dependency-tree analysis against relevant project root types instead of applying it blindly to every class.

- Treat cognitive-complexity values as maximum limits, not utilization targets.
- Do not attempt to keep classes or functions close to their complexity limits.
- Prefer cohesive classes with low complexity when the responsibility is naturally simple.
- A new class must reduce total system complexity, isolate a meaningful responsibility, enforce an invariant or establish a real architectural boundary.
- Do not extract a new class merely to reduce a complexity score, shorten a file or satisfy an arbitrary line-count target.
- Prefer private methods inside the existing class when extracted logic:
  - belongs exclusively to that class,
  - shares the same lifecycle,
  - uses the same dependencies,
  - and is unlikely to be reused or substituted independently.
- Keep tightly related, single-use behavior together unless doing so causes mixed responsibilities or excessive branching.
- Do not create one-method classes unless the type has a clear role, such as:
  - an adapter,
  - command,
  - handler,
  - strategy,
  - specification,
  - value object,
  - middleware,
  - or callable extension point.
- Do not create separate files for trivial wrappers that add no validation, behavior, abstraction or operational value.
- Do not split a cohesive class only because it contains many private methods.
- Split a class when it has multiple reasons to change, unrelated dependencies, separate lifecycle requirements or independently replaceable behavior.
- Evaluate extraction by net complexity:
  - additional files,
  - additional symbols,
  - constructor dependencies,
  - dispatch layers,
  - autoload work,
  - configuration,
  - and navigation cost.
- Reject a refactoring that lowers local cognitive complexity while increasing total system complexity.
- Do not enforce arbitrary minimum or maximum class line counts.
- Small value objects, enums, exceptions, DTOs, attributes and adapters are valid when they represent meaningful concepts.

### Structural Compression And Call-Hop Reduction

- Prefer the smallest coherent structure that preserves correctness, cohesion, explicit contracts, maintainability and operational safety.
- Treat class count, file count, method count and call depth as diagnostic signals rather than independent optimization targets.
- Reduce unnecessary:
  - classes,
  - interfaces,
  - traits,
  - files,
  - methods,
  - wrappers,
  - factories,
  - adapters,
  - managers,
  - handlers,
  - processors,
  - executors,
  - events,
  - DTO conversions,
  - and delegation layers.
- Do not treat more classes, files or methods as evidence of better architecture.
- Do not minimize symbol or file count blindly when separation protects a meaningful boundary.
- Remove pass-through layers that only:
  - forward the same arguments,
  - delegate to one collaborator,
  - return the delegated result unchanged,
  - rename an existing operation,
  - repeat validation already completed at a trusted boundary,
  - or convert between equivalent representations without enforcing a contract.
- Prefer a direct method call when:
  - the caller knows the required collaborator,
  - no implementation substitution is required,
  - no independent lifecycle exists,
  - no policy or invariant is enforced,
  - and the additional layer provides no architectural or measured value.
- Treat chains such as the following as review signals when intermediate layers add no responsibility:
  - controller → service → manager → handler → processor,
  - repository → gateway → adapter → client,
  - command → dispatcher → executor → worker,
  - and model → mapper → DTO → presenter → response mapper.
- Merge classes when they:
  - have the same lifecycle,
  - use substantially the same dependencies,
  - change for the same reason,
  - cannot be meaningfully used independently,
  - and become clearer as one cohesive type.
- Keep classes separate when they represent:
  - different responsibilities,
  - different lifecycles,
  - independently replaceable implementations,
  - public extension contracts,
  - security or authorization boundaries,
  - transaction ownership,
  - external-provider boundaries,
  - independently scalable processes,
  - or independently testable policy.
- Inline a private method when it:
  - is used once,
  - performs a trivial operation,
  - does not name an important concept,
  - enforces no invariant,
  - isolates no meaningful decision,
  - and only adds another call hop.
- Keep or extract a method when it:
  - names an important concept,
  - isolates a complex decision,
  - prevents meaningful duplication,
  - improves testability,
  - enforces an invariant,
  - or makes the caller materially easier to understand.
- Co-locate tightly coupled, single-use implementation details when separate files add navigation and autoload overhead without architectural value.
- Prefer one primary public autoloadable symbol per file.
- Do not combine unrelated public symbols merely to reduce file count.
- Remove redundant entity, DTO, array, transport and response conversions.
- Keep one internal representation through as much of the execution path as practical.
- Perform framework, PSR, transport, persistence and provider adaptation once at the relevant boundary.
- Avoid repeated validation, normalization, mapping and serialization at successive call hops.
- Do not split cohesive code solely to reduce line count, one local complexity score or satisfy a design pattern.
- Do not merge unrelated code solely to reduce symbols, files or method calls.
- Evaluate structural compression by its effect on:
  - sustained successful RPM,
  - executed method calls,
  - autoloaded symbols,
  - bootstrap work,
  - allocations,
  - conversions,
  - cognitive complexity,
  - dependency count,
  - test surface,
  - stack-trace clarity,
  - and navigation cost.
- In measured hot paths, prefer fewer meaningful call hops when equivalent behavior remains clear and safe.
- Do not require a dedicated benchmark for every trivial pass-through removal.
- Require representative measurement when compression changes public behavior, lifecycle, dependency resolution, request composition, middleware, database access, serialization or another frequently executed path.
- When two structures provide equivalent correctness, safety and sustained RPM, prefer the one with fewer unnecessary abstractions, dependencies, conversions, execution hops and maintenance costs.

- Every new class, interface, enum, trait, DTO, wrapper, handler and file must justify its existence.
- Prefer adding behavior to an existing cohesive type over creating a new type with no independent responsibility.
- Create a new type when it provides at least one meaningful benefit:
  - stronger type safety,
  - invariant enforcement,
  - independent substitution,
  - lifecycle separation,
  - public contract stability,
  - reusable behavior,
  - or reduced total system complexity.
- Do not create a type merely to:
  - satisfy a pattern,
  - reduce line count,
  - lower a local complexity score,
  - enable mocking,
  - rename a scalar,
  - or make the directory structure appear more architectural.
- Optimize for the smallest coherent type system, not the smallest individual files.
- Count abstraction overhead as part of the design cost:
  - additional files,
  - autoloaded symbols,
  - dependency injection wiring,
  - runtime dispatch,
  - configuration,
  - testing surface,
  - and maintenance burden.
- Reject abstractions whose expected value is speculative or smaller than their ongoing operational and cognitive cost.

- Do not create an interface, DTO, value object, event, exception or adapter merely because code is packaged as a library.
- Retain stronger types and abstractions when they prevent invalid states or define a real public contract.
- Avoid hidden global state and service location.
- Avoid unnecessary middleware, listeners, observers, decorators, wrappers, DTO conversions and container lookups on hot routes.
- Prefer direct calls over dynamic dispatch when extension or substitution is not required.
- Avoid chains of tiny method calls in measured hot paths when equivalent cohesive code is clearer and materially faster.
- Keep classes, interfaces, traits, enums and functions in predictable Composer-autoloadable locations.
- Do not create unnecessary wrappers or fragmented files that add autoload and declaration overhead without design value.

### Interfaces, Containers And Extension Contracts

- Create an interface only when it defines a meaningful contract or substitution boundary.
- Do not create an interface for every class by default.
- Do not create an interface solely because dependency injection, mocking or a design pattern makes it possible.
- Do not create an interface when there is one internal implementation, no expected substitution and no meaningful architectural boundary.
- Prefer a concrete `final` class for internal implementation details that are not designed for extension or substitution.
- Introduce an interface when at least one of the following is true:
  - multiple implementations currently exist,
  - consumers must provide their own implementation,
  - the contract forms part of the library's supported public extension surface,
  - the implementation crosses a significant infrastructure or third-party boundary,
  - runtime strategy or driver selection is required,
  - or separate modules must depend on a stable contract rather than implementation details.
- Public visibility alone does not require an interface.
- Public immutable value objects, DTOs, factories, exceptions and utility types may remain concrete classes.
- Do not create an interface only to make a class mockable in tests.
- Prefer testing through observable behavior or substituting real architectural boundaries.
- Keep internal interfaces private to the package or module when they are not part of the supported public API.
- Do not expose an interface publicly unless compatibility and long-term maintenance of that contract are intentional.
- When only one implementation exists, name it according to its actual responsibility rather than adding redundant names such as `Default`, `Base` or `Impl`.
- Avoid paired files such as `UserServiceInterface` and `UserService` unless the interface has a concrete architectural purpose.
- Design public library extension through interfaces and composition rather than requiring consumers to inherit from concrete classes.

**Dependency Containers And Composition Roots**

- Use PSR-11 `ContainerInterface` only when an interoperable container boundary is genuinely required.
- Keep container access at the composition root, framework bridge, plugin loader or another explicit integration boundary.
- Do not inject a container into domain, application or library objects so they can retrieve their own dependencies.
- Do not use PSR-11 as a service locator.
- Resolve dependencies once and inject the required concrete services or narrow interfaces.
- Do not perform repeated container lookups inside requests, loops or other hot paths.
- Compile or cache container wiring during build or bootstrap where the implementation supports it.
- Do not require `psr/container` in a reusable package unless the package actually consumes or provides the PSR-11 contract.
- When a framework container is adapted to PSR-11, perform the adaptation once at the integration boundary.

### Enums, Constants And Value Types

- Use enums for meaningful closed sets of domain or contract values.
- Do not create an enum merely to replace every group of constants or strings.
- Prefer an enum when:
  - the value has a distinct domain identity,
  - only a fixed set of values is valid,
  - exhaustive handling is desirable,
  - type-safe parameters or return values improve correctness,
  - or behavior meaningfully belongs to each case.
- Use backed enums when a stable scalar representation is required for storage, serialization, messaging or external contracts.
- Validate external backed-enum values explicitly with `tryFrom()` or an equivalent boundary conversion.
- Do not pass arbitrary external strings deep into the application when they represent a known enum type.
- Prefer class constants when values are:
  - implementation-local,
  - configuration keys,
  - header names,
  - default limits,
  - regular-expression fragments,
  - numeric flags,
  - algorithm parameters,
  - cache-key prefixes,
  - or other values without independent domain identity.
- Prefer private constants inside the owning class when the values are used only there.
- Do not create a separate enum or constants file for values that belong exclusively to one class.
- Do not create generic `Constants`, `CommonConstants` or `GlobalConstants` classes.
- Keep constants close to the behavior that owns them.
- Do not use an enum for an open-ended or externally extensible set.
- Do not use an enum when new values may be introduced independently by consumers, plugins, providers or third-party systems.
- Do not create an enum for a single local conditional unless it improves the public contract or prevents invalid states.
- Do not attach unrelated utility behavior to enums merely to avoid creating an appropriate service.
- Prefer exhaustive `match` handling for enums when every case must be considered.
- Avoid a default `match` arm for enums when explicit handling provides safer change detection.

### Autoloadable File And Symbol Structure

- Prefer one primary autoloadable symbol per file.
- Do not combine unrelated classes into large files merely to reduce file count.
- Keep autoloadable files free from request-specific top-level execution and unrelated side effects.
- Prefer file-scope declarations with runtime decisions inside methods.
- Avoid conditional class, function, enum, interface or trait declarations unless explicitly required.
- Avoid named functions declared inside methods, conditions or loops.

## Request Processing, Data Loading And Serialization

### Request-Path Execution

- Minimize the amount of PHP code executed per request.
- Keep the common request path short, direct and predictable.
- Avoid loading, resolving, validating, constructing or serializing data that the request does not use.
- Do not add a cross-cutting layer to every request when only a subset of routes requires it.
- Compile stable routes, configuration, dependency mappings and metadata before serving traffic.
- Do not perform route discovery, directory scanning, annotation parsing, reflection discovery or container compilation during requests.
- Avoid repeated `.env`, YAML, XML or JSON configuration parsing in request paths.
- Avoid exceptions for expected control flow.
- Validate and normalize untrusted input once at the trust boundary, then use the validated internal representation.
- Do not repeat equivalent validation at every internal layer.
- Keep response payloads limited to fields required by the caller.
- Avoid eager object hydration when arrays, scalar projections or streamed rows are sufficient.
- Avoid callbacks and intermediate arrays in large, frequently executed transformations when one explicit loop performs the same work.
- Avoid synchronous database, filesystem, network or process calls that are not required to complete the response.
- Batch required I/O whenever batching improves total RPM.
- Use bounded concurrency for independent I/O only when it improves end-to-end throughput and does not overload downstream systems.
- Cache or precompute stable high-cost work when the hit rate and reuse justify construction, storage and invalidation costs.
- Do not add caching to one-time or low-reuse operations.
- Keep mandatory observability structured, bounded and inexpensive.
- Do not construct expensive log context when the corresponding log level is disabled.
- Keep authentication and authorization correct while avoiding duplicate resolution, parsing and database access.
- Reuse already loaded immutable request data instead of fetching or transforming it repeatedly.
- Remove dead request-path work before pursuing syntax-level micro-optimizations.

### Lazy, Eager And Prefetched Loading

- Do not treat lazy loading, eager loading or prefetching as universally faster.
- Select the strategy using representative:
  - sustained successful RPM,
  - query count,
  - I/O round trips,
  - first-use latency,
  - warm-reuse latency,
  - peak memory,
  - worker density,
  - tail latency,
  - and resource lifetime.
- Use lazy loading for optional, expensive work that most execution paths do not require.
- Use eager loading or prefetching when:
  - data or dependencies are required by nearly every execution,
  - related work can be batched,
  - initialization can be amortized safely,
  - or delayed loading would create repeated I/O or unpredictable latency.
- Do not use lazy loading merely to hide expensive work behind:
  - property access,
  - magic methods,
  - service locators,
  - container resolution,
  - reflection,
  - database relations,
  - filesystem discovery,
  - configuration lookup,
  - secret-store access,
  - or network calls.
- Keep expensive I/O explicit at the request, service, repository, adapter or operation boundary.
- Avoid ORM or repository lazy loading inside loops when it can create N+1 queries.
- Prefer explicit joins, projections, batch lookups, `WHERE IN` queries, data loaders or bounded prefetching when they reduce total round trips.
- Do not eagerly load complete object graphs when only a scalar, identifier, aggregate or narrow projection is required.
- Select only the fields and relationships needed by the current operation.
- Do not eager-load large or unbounded relationships without:
  - limits,
  - pagination,
  - streaming,
  - cursors,
  - or chunking.
- Prefer bounded prefetching when full eager loading would exceed memory, result-size, query, lock or transaction budgets.
- Do not issue several lazy loads for values that can be resolved in one request or one database round trip.
- Do not perform eager initialization for optional integrations that most requests never use.
- For optional dependencies:
  - initialize lazily,
  - memoize only when reuse is expected,
  - keep the lifecycle explicit,
  - and ensure state cannot leak across requests or callers.
- For dependencies used by nearly every request, compare eager startup construction with lazy first-use construction and repeated lazy checks.
- Validate mandatory dependencies, configuration and required backing services before traffic is accepted.
- Compile stable routes, dependency mappings, event mappings, serializer metadata and similar structures during build, release or startup.
- Do not lazily perform directory scanning, annotation parsing, reflection discovery, route compilation or container compilation during requests.
- Keep first-use initialization deterministic and bounded.
- Avoid lazy initialization whose first call produces unacceptable `p95` or `p99` latency.
- Prevent concurrent first-use stampedes when several workers or requests may initialize the same expensive resource.
- Use locking, single-flight behavior, build-time generation or deployment warm-up only when the coordination cost is justified.
- Do not let eager cache or metadata warming overload databases, caches or external services during startup or deployment.
- Warm only representative high-reuse entries, routes, classes or metadata.
- Use bounded concurrency for warm-up.
- Keep warm-up failure behavior explicit and operationally safe.
- Generators, iterators, cursors and streams are lazy execution mechanisms, not automatically lower-cost execution mechanisms.
- Use lazy iteration for large or unbounded data when reduced peak memory outweighs longer resource occupancy.
- Do not let a lazy iterator retain:
  - a database connection,
  - transaction,
  - lock,
  - file descriptor,
  - stream,
  - HTTP response body,
  - or external-service lease
  longer than intended.
- Prefer bounded eager chunks when they:
  - release resources sooner,
  - increase worker availability,
  - improve batching,
  - or produce higher total RPM.
- Do not convert a lazy iterable into a full array unless full materialization is required.
- Do not consume a lazy stream more than once unless it is explicitly rewindable or buffered.
- Cache a lazily loaded value only when:
  - it is immutable or safely scoped,
  - repeated reuse is expected,
  - memory remains bounded,
  - invalidation behavior is defined,
  - and persistent-worker state cannot leak across callers.
- Do not memoize request-specific, user-specific, tenant-specific, authorization-sensitive or secret data in static or long-lived objects.
- In persistent workers, test:
  - first initialization,
  - repeated reuse,
  - request reset,
  - tenant isolation,
  - failure recovery,
  - and memory stability.
- Treat eager validation differently from eager data loading:
  - eagerly validate mandatory configuration and contracts before accepting work,
  - but do not eagerly fetch optional business data that the operation may never use.
- Treat eager dependency construction differently from eager external connection:
  - constructing a lightweight immutable client may be safe,
  - opening a database, cache, file or network connection should remain demand-driven unless startup validation explicitly requires it.
- Do not keep an external connection open merely because its client object was eagerly constructed.
- Measure cold-first-use and warm-reuse behavior separately.
- Include the actual request mix so optional-path savings and common-path penalties are represented correctly.
- Prefer the strategy with the highest sustainable successful RPM that stays within explicit:
  - query,
  - latency,
  - memory,
  - worker-density,
  - connection,
  - and operational-stability budgets.

- Do not rely on lazy loading in performance-sensitive paths without verifying the resulting query count.
- Benchmark lazy, joined, batched and chunked relation-loading strategies with representative cardinality and concurrency.
- Do not eager-load large relationship graphs when the request needs only a subset of fields or relations.
- Avoid N+1 query patterns.
- Prefer explicit eager loading, joins, projections or batched prefetching when related data is required across a collection.

- Make optional library integrations lazy so unused dependencies do not affect bootstrap or common-path RPM.
- Eagerly construct lightweight immutable dependencies used by nearly every operation only when startup cost, retained memory and failure behavior are acceptable.
- Do not let lazy library initialization hide database, filesystem, network, reflection or container work.

### HTTP Messages, Handlers And Middleware

- Use PSR-7 HTTP messages at public package, middleware and framework-bridge boundaries where implementation independence is required.
- Do not convert repeatedly between framework-native requests and PSR-7 messages.
- Adapt once at the boundary and retain one representation through the internal request path.
- Respect PSR-7 message immutability and stream cursor semantics.
- Avoid long chains of `with*()` calls that create unnecessary message copies in measured hot paths; group boundary changes where practical.
- Do not assume request or response bodies are rewindable, seekable or safely readable more than once.
- When a reusable component must create PSR-7 messages or streams, depend on the narrow PSR-17 factory interfaces it actually needs.
- Do not couple reusable middleware or handlers to one concrete PSR-7 implementation.
- Use PSR-15 for reusable server request handlers and middleware.
- Do not add middleware layers merely to claim PSR-15 compliance.
- Keep exception-to-response handling at the outer request boundary so failures produce controlled responses.
- Keep authorization and other security middleware ordered explicitly.
- Benchmark the complete middleware stack and remove layers that provide no required behavior.
- Use PSR-13 only when the application or library genuinely models hypermedia links independently of serialization format.
- Do not introduce PSR-13 for ordinary URLs, redirects or APIs that do not expose hypermedia controls.

### JSON And Request Bodies

- Use `json_validate()` when only JSON syntax validation is required and the decoded value will not be consumed.
- Do not call `json_validate()` immediately before `json_decode()` on the normal valid path because it parses the payload twice.
- When decoded data is required, decode once and use `JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR` where appropriate.
- Keep validation and decoding depth and UTF-8 policies consistent.
- Bound JSON payload size and nesting depth before parsing untrusted input.
- Do not decode the same immutable JSON payload repeatedly in one request.
- Reuse the decoded representation when ownership and mutation rules are clear.
- Avoid repeated array-to-object and object-to-array conversions after decoding.
- Benchmark validation-only, decode-only and decode-plus-validation paths separately when JSON processing materially affects RPM.

- Ensure exactly one request-boundary component owns body parsing.
- Treat request-body consumption as destructive.
- On supported runtimes, consider `request_parse_body()` for `multipart/form-data` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies on non-`POST` requests.
- Call `request_parse_body()` at most once per request.
- Do not read `php://input` before calling `request_parse_body()`.
- When several consumers need the raw body, buffer it once through an explicitly bounded mechanism and share that representation.
- Apply explicit limits for:
  - total body size,
  - file size,
  - file count,
  - input-variable count,
  - multipart-part count,
  - and nesting depth.
- Handle parse failures and invalid-limit errors at the request boundary.
- Do not copy parsed values into superglobals unless an established application contract requires it.
- Do not use multipart or form parsers for JSON payloads.

### Serialization And Output

- Avoid repeated serialization and deserialization of the same payload.
- Do not construct response fields the caller does not need.
- Bound internal and external payload sizes.
- Stream large exports and downloads instead of buffering the entire output.
- Avoid many tiny writes when output can be safely buffered or streamed more efficiently.
- Do not build one extremely large in-memory string merely to reduce output calls.

## Collections, Iteration And Memory

### Arrays, Strings And Membership

- Prefer direct array access guarded by `isset()` when null and missing are equivalent.
- Use `array_key_exists()` only for true null-presence semantics.
- For repeated membership checks, prefer a keyed set and `isset($set[$key])` over repeated `in_array()` scans when the one-time set construction is justified.
- Use strict `in_array($value, $items, true)` for one-off membership checks where a keyed set would add unnecessary allocation.
- Avoid calling `array_keys()` merely to iterate or test membership.
- Avoid `array_map()`, `array_filter()` and `array_reduce()` chains on large or hot-path arrays when one explicit loop can avoid callbacks, intermediate arrays and repeated traversal.
- Use native array functions when they perform the complete operation clearly and without creating unnecessary intermediate data.
- Avoid repeated `array_merge()` in loops; append directly or accumulate chunks and merge once when appropriate.
- Avoid the array spread operator in large repeated merges when it creates avoidable copies.
- Avoid copying large arrays merely to preserve style. Mutate only when ownership is clear and mutation is safe.
- Do not build an index, lookup map or transformed array unless its reuse saves more work than its construction and memory cost.

**Native Array And String Operations**

- Prefer `array_is_list()` over manually comparing keys when list detection is required.
- Use `array_key_first()` and `array_key_last()` when only the key is required.
- On supported runtimes, use `array_first()` and `array_last()` when only the value is required and `null` ambiguity is acceptable.
- Use `array_find()` or `array_find_key()` when their nullable return semantics match the contract.
- Prefer `array_find_key()` when a matching value may be `null` and absence must remain distinguishable.
- Use `array_any()` and `array_all()` for short-circuit predicate checks when their callback cost is acceptable.
- In large or measured hot paths, compare callback-based helpers against a direct `foreach` with an early return.
- Do not use `array_filter()` merely to determine whether any matching element exists.
- Prefer `str_contains()`, `str_starts_with()` and `str_ends_with()` over error-prone `strpos()` comparison idioms when byte-string semantics are correct.
- Use `mb_*` or grapheme-aware operations only when Unicode semantics are required.
- Do not pay multibyte or grapheme-processing cost for ASCII-only identifiers, protocol tokens or internal keys.
- Do not replace one direct operation with several native calls that introduce extra passes or allocations.

### Iteration And Algorithmic Work

- Treat total work, algorithmic complexity, allocations and I/O as more important than the number of visible loops.
- When multiple loops process the same dataset in the same execution path, evaluate whether they can be safely combined.
- Combine loops when doing so removes meaningful repeated work without harming clarity or testability.
- Do not force unrelated responsibilities into one loop merely to reduce the loop count.
- A clear two-pass `O(n)` solution is preferable to a coupled or error-prone one-pass implementation.
- Avoid repeatedly scanning the same collection for values that can be indexed once.
- Build keyed lookup maps or sets when repeated membership checks would otherwise require linear searches.
- Question nested loops and repeated searches that create avoidable `O(n²)` behavior.
- Short-circuit iteration as soon as the required result is known.
- Avoid sorting an entire dataset when only a minimum, maximum, first match or limited top set is needed.
- Avoid repeated filtering, mapping, sorting, grouping and reindexing of the same large dataset.
- Be aware of hidden full passes and temporary arrays created by chained array or collection operations.
- In measured hot paths, prefer a clear explicit loop when it avoids several traversals and allocations.
- Move invariant calculations, parsing, normalization, pattern preparation and lookups outside loops.
- Never perform database, network, filesystem, process or other expensive I/O inside a loop when the work can be batched or prefetched.
- Apply bounded chunking when a single batch could exceed memory, query-size, payload, lock or downstream-service limits.

- Prefer `foreach` for normal array and iterable traversal.
- Use `for` when numeric indexes, counters or bounded positional access are intrinsic to the algorithm.
- Use `while` when iteration is naturally condition-driven.
- Do not choose `for`, `foreach` or `while` based solely on generic syntax benchmarks.
- Do not convert associative arrays into key lists merely to iterate with `for`.

**By-Reference `foreach` Cleanup**

- Avoid by-reference `foreach` unless in-place mutation is required and preferable to constructing a replacement array.
- After a by-reference `foreach`, the loop variable remains bound to the final iterated element.
- Call `unset($item)` immediately after the loop when execution may continue in the same variable scope.
- Cleanup is required when:
  - another loop or assignment may reuse the loop variable,
  - additional logic follows the loop,
  - the reference points to an array or object property,
  - a `catch` or `finally` block may continue execution in the same function,
  - or protecting against likely later refactoring is more valuable than removing one cleanup operation.
- Cleanup may be omitted only when control immediately and unconditionally exits the current variable scope:
  - the loop is followed directly by `return`,
  - the loop is the final statement in the function or closure,
  - or execution immediately throws an exception that is not handled within the same function scope.
- Do not omit cleanup merely because the method is currently short when additional code already follows the loop.
- Do not use `unset()` inside the loop.
- Do not generalize this rule to ordinary variables or non-reference loops.
- The `unset()` breaks the lingering reference; it is a correctness operation, not a memory-release optimization.

Required cleanup example:

```php
foreach ($items as &$item) {
    $item->normalize();
}

unset($item);

persist($items);
```

Safe omission at an immediate scope exit:

```php
foreach ($items as &$item) {
    $item->normalize();
}

return $items;
```

- Avoid repeatedly evaluating non-trivial expressions in loop conditions.
- Precompute loop bounds when doing so removes meaningful work, stabilizes intended behavior or improves clarity.
- Do not cache trivial values by default when the benefit is unmeasured and the additional state reduces readability.

### Data Movement, Memory And Variable Lifetime

- Treat peak memory and data movement as first-class performance concerns.
- Avoid materializing an entire dataset when it can be processed incrementally.
- Prefer generators, iterators, streams, cursors or chunking for large or potentially unbounded datasets.
- Do not convert a generator, cursor, stream or iterator into an array unless full materialization is required.
- Avoid unnecessary intermediate arrays and repeated array copies.
- Avoid repeatedly converting the same data among arrays, objects, JSON, XML and serialized formats.
- Keep data in the simplest useful representation for as long as practical.
- Select and retain only the fields needed by the current operation.
- Avoid hydrating large object graphs for read-only projections, reports or exports.
- Prefer incremental encoding and output for large responses.
- Use temporary streams or files when keeping the entire generated payload in memory is unnecessary.
- Close files, streams, cursors, processes and external resources through their explicit lifecycle APIs when they are no longer needed.
- Allow ordinary PHP variables and values to be released naturally at scope exit.
- Avoid unbounded in-memory accumulation in workers, consumers, daemons and long-running commands.
- Reset request-specific or job-specific state in long-running processes.
- Use worker recycling as a safety mechanism, not as a substitute for fixing memory growth.
- Do not increase memory limits to hide avoidable full-dataset loading or leaks.

- Do not use `unset()` as a routine performance or memory optimization.
- Do not add `unset()` after ordinary assignments, method calls, loops or processing steps.
- Rely on PHP scope and reference counting for ordinary local variables.
- Do not call `unset()` inside hot loops unless element removal is required by the algorithm.
- Do not unset a value immediately before `return`, function completion or scope exit.
- Do not unset parameters or object properties merely because they are no longer used locally.
- Avoid repeated removal of elements from large arrays as a memory strategy; mutation, hash-table maintenance and allocator churn can cost more than retaining the value briefly.
- Prefer smaller scopes, dedicated per-job methods, generators, streaming and bounded chunking over manual cleanup.
- Use `unset()` only when:
  - breaking the lingering reference after a by-reference `foreach`,
  - removing a key or value is required by program behavior,
  - a demonstrably large temporary value otherwise remains live across substantial later work,
  - or profiling shows that earlier release materially reduces peak memory without harming throughput.
- Treat early object destruction as observable behavior when destructors or external resources are involved.
- Use explicit lifecycle operations such as `fclose()` for external resources; do not use `unset()` as a substitute.
- Do not bulk-apply `unset()` through automated refactoring.
- Benchmark elapsed time and peak memory before retaining manual lifetime management.

- Do not assume that allocating more memory is cheaper than performing another CPU operation.
- A heap allocation, PHP array growth, object construction, reference-count update or cache miss can cost far more than a simple arithmetic operation, comparison or branch.
- Prefer one extra trivial CPU operation over a new allocation or data copy when both produce equivalent behavior.
- Prefer bounded additional memory when it eliminates materially more expensive work, such as:
  - repeated database or network I/O,
  - repeated parsing or serialization,
  - repeated full scans,
  - expensive recomputation,
  - or avoidable lock contention.
- Trade memory for speed only when the retained data will be reused enough to justify its allocation, initialization and lookup cost.
- Keep every memory-for-speed trade bounded by a known maximum, TTL, request scope, chunk size or eviction policy.
- Do not retain large maps, caches or object graphs for speculative reuse.
- Avoid memory usage that risks swapping, container eviction, PHP memory-limit failure or reduced worker density; these outcomes can produce severe latency regressions.
- Remember that PHP arrays are hash tables with substantial per-element overhead. Do not use large arrays as free or low-cost memory.
- For repeated membership checks, a keyed set with `isset()` may be faster than repeated linear scans, but build it only when the number of lookups justifies the one-time allocation.
- For one pass over a large dataset, prefer streaming or a direct loop instead of building additional indexes or copies.
- Measure wall-clock time, sustained throughput and peak memory together.
- Choose the fastest measured option that remains within explicit stability, memory, concurrency and capacity limits.
- Resource efficiency is secondary to speed unless resource pressure reduces throughput, increases latency or threatens operational stability.
- Prefer predictable, bounded memory consumption over the lowest possible memory consumption.
- Do not optimize memory in a way that adds significant CPU work unless memory pressure, worker density or peak-memory limits require it.

## Security, Identity And Cryptography

### Security And Operational Safety

- Apply secure-by-default design and OWASP-aligned practices where relevant.
- Treat validation, escaping, authorization, secrets management and dependency hygiene as mandatory.
- Mark sensitive parameters for stack-trace redaction when the supported runtime provides `#[\SensitiveParameter]`, while continuing to keep secrets out of logs and exception messages.
- Validate at trust boundaries.
- Encode for the destination context.
- Prefer safe failure, reduced blast radius, idempotency and operationally safe behavior.
- Consider logs, metrics, traces, health checks, timeouts, retries and configuration discipline.
- Avoid exposing sensitive diagnostic or implementation details in production errors.
- Ensure performance optimizations cannot bypass authorization, tenant isolation, validation or audit requirements.
- Treat resource exhaustion as both a security and reliability concern.
- Bound request sizes, collection sizes, recursion, concurrency, execution time and retry behavior.

### Security-Critical Libraries And Time

- Apply maximum-throughput rules to security-sensitive libraries only after correctness and security requirements are fully preserved.
- Never weaken:
  - cryptographic algorithms,
  - entropy sources,
  - secret handling,
  - timing-safety requirements,
  - replay protection,
  - rate limiting,
  - token validation,
  - authorization,
  - or input validation
  to improve RPM.
- For OTP libraries:
  - avoid unnecessary object creation and repeated normalization,
  - validate reusable configuration once where safe,
  - reuse immutable algorithm configuration,
  - avoid repeated encoding or time-source work within the same operation,
  - and use timing-safe comparison where required.
- Do not cache generated OTP values, secrets or verification decisions across callers unless the protocol explicitly requires it and scope is secure.
- Benchmark OTP generation and verification separately.
- Include valid, invalid, expired, malformed and replay-related paths in representative benchmarks.
- Treat rate limiting and replay protection as part of the production throughput model rather than removing them from tests.

**Time And Clock Boundaries**

- Use PSR-20 `ClockInterface` when a reusable or test-sensitive component requires an interoperable source of current time.
- Inject the clock through construction or explicit configuration.
- Do not resolve the clock repeatedly from a container.
- Read the clock once per logical operation unless the protocol explicitly requires another reading.
- For TOTP verification, capture the current time once and derive every candidate time step from that value.
- For repeated expiration or timeout calculations in one operation, reuse the captured timestamp or immutable time value.
- Production clocks must represent real current time according to the application's documented timezone contract.
- Tests may use deterministic or frozen clocks.
- Do not use process-global clock mutation when an injected clock can provide isolated behavior.
- Do not introduce a clock abstraction into purely deterministic code that receives time as an explicit input.
- In an ultra-hot internal loop, pass a precomputed timestamp rather than calling `ClockInterface::now()` repeatedly.
- Include clock-call and date-conversion costs in OTP and expiration benchmarks when they materially affect RPM.

### Hashing And Identifier Selection

- Select a hashing primitive by purpose before considering benchmark speed.
- Do not treat cryptographic hashes, non-cryptographic hashes, HMACs, password hashes, checksums and unique identifiers as interchangeable.
- Optimize hashing only after preserving the required collision resistance, authenticity, interoperability and threat model.
- Benchmark hashing with the project's actual:
  - PHP version,
  - CPU architecture,
  - payload sizes,
  - call frequency,
  - output representation,
  - and request lifecycle.
- Do not choose an algorithm solely from a large-buffer throughput benchmark.
- Measure the effect on complete sustained successful RPM in addition to isolated hashes per second or bytes per second.

**Non-Cryptographic Hashing**

- Use non-cryptographic hashes only when maliciously chosen collisions cannot compromise:
  - authorization,
  - authentication,
  - integrity,
  - cache isolation,
  - deduplication correctness,
  - database uniqueness,
  - signatures,
  - or security decisions.
- On supported PHP versions, prefer `xxh3` as the first candidate for high-throughput non-cryptographic hashing when a 64-bit result is sufficient.
- Prefer `xxh128` when a wider 128-bit result materially reduces accidental-collision risk and the additional output size is acceptable.
- Use MurmurHash variants when compatibility, seeded distribution or an existing contract requires them and representative benchmarks justify the choice.
- Use `crc32c`, `crc32`, `crc32b` and Adler variants only for checksums, protocol compatibility or corruption detection where their collision properties are acceptable.
- Do not use CRC, xxHash, MurmurHash, FNV, Jenkins or Adler hashes for cryptographic integrity, secrets, signatures, authentication tokens or attacker-controlled security decisions.
- Treat every non-cryptographic digest as collision-prone.
- Define how collisions are detected or handled before using a non-cryptographic hash as a lookup key, cache key, fingerprint or deduplication hint.
- Prefer the shortest output that satisfies measured collision and storage requirements; do not widen every hash by default.
- Use raw binary output internally when storage, comparison and transport contracts support it.
- Encode to hexadecimal, Base64 or another text format only at a boundary that requires text.
- Avoid hashing data that can be used directly as a safe bounded scalar key without additional work.
- Do not repeatedly hash the same immutable value in one request; compute once and reuse the digest when the reuse is measurable and scope is clear.

**Cryptographic Digests**

- Use a cryptographic hash when collision resistance or adversarial input matters but no secret-key authenticity is required.
- Prefer `sha256` as the default interoperable cryptographic digest for new general-purpose designs.
- Consider `sha512`, `sha512/256` or another approved cryptographic algorithm only when:
  - interoperability permits it,
  - output requirements are satisfied,
  - and representative benchmarks on target hardware show a useful throughput improvement.
- Do not assume `sha256` is always faster than SHA-512-family algorithms on every CPU.
- Do not use `md5` or `sha1` for new collision-sensitive or security-sensitive designs.
- Preserve legacy algorithms only when required by an established protocol or compatibility contract.
- Do not replace a protocol-defined hash merely because another algorithm is faster.
- Use streaming hash APIs or file-hashing APIs for large inputs instead of loading the complete payload into memory.
- Avoid hashing the same payload multiple times with different encodings unless the external contract requires it.
- Do not use a plain cryptographic digest where authenticity requires a secret; use HMAC or an appropriate digital-signature primitive.

**Unique And Opaque Identifiers**

- Hashing does not create uniqueness.
- Do not use a hash of a timestamp, sequence, email address, database identifier or other predictable value as a secure opaque identifier.
- For random opaque identifiers, generate sufficient bytes with `random_bytes()` or an appropriate cryptographically secure identifier implementation.
- Encode random identifiers only once for storage or transport.
- Enforce uniqueness with a database or storage-level unique constraint and handle the extremely rare collision with a bounded retry when required.
- For deterministic identifiers or fingerprints:
  - define the canonical input representation,
  - define whether hostile collisions are possible,
  - define the acceptable collision probability,
  - and define collision handling.
- Use a cryptographic digest such as `sha256` for deterministic identifiers when collisions could affect correctness, tenancy, authorization, financial state or security.
- Consider `xxh128` for non-adversarial deterministic fingerprints only when collision handling exists and representative throughput measurements justify it.
- Do not truncate identifiers or digests without an explicit collision analysis.
- Do not confuse obscuring an identifier with securing access to the underlying resource.

**HMAC Selection And Usage**

- Use HMAC when a shared secret must authenticate a message or detect tampering.
- Prefer `hash_hmac('sha256', ...)` as the default interoperable HMAC for new general-purpose designs.
- Consider HMAC-SHA-512 or HMAC-SHA-512/256 only when:
  - both sides support the algorithm,
  - the protocol allows algorithm selection,
  - and representative benchmarks show a useful end-to-end RPM improvement.
- Use only algorithms returned by `hash_hmac_algos()`.
- Do not attempt to use xxHash, CRC, MurmurHash or another non-cryptographic hash with HMAC.
- Do not accept a user-controlled HMAC algorithm name directly.
- Resolve and validate configurable algorithm names once at configuration or bootstrap time rather than repeatedly in a hot path.
- Generate new HMAC keys from a cryptographically secure source such as `random_bytes()`.
- Do not use predictable identifiers, timestamps or low-entropy passwords directly as HMAC keys.
- Use an appropriate key-derivation function when an HMAC key must be derived from password-like material.
- Keep HMAC keys separate by purpose.
- Use explicit domain separation, protocol versioning or context prefixes when one key could otherwise authenticate several message types.
- Avoid ambiguous field concatenation.
- Canonicalize or length-prefix structured fields before computing the HMAC.
- Compute the HMAC over the exact bytes defined by the protocol.
- Prefer raw binary HMAC output for internal processing when contracts permit:

```php
$mac = hash_hmac('sha256', $payload, $secretKey, true);
```

- Encode the HMAC once at the external boundary when a textual signature is required.
- Compare received and expected MAC values with `hash_equals()`.
- Pass the trusted expected value as the first argument and the user-provided value as the second argument.
- Compare values in the same encoding and expected length.
- Do not compare secret MAC values with `==` or `===`.
- Do not truncate an HMAC unless an established protocol requires it or a documented security analysis approves the tag length.
- HMAC authenticates data; it does not encrypt or hide the message.
- Use incremental HMAC or file-HMAC APIs for large streams and files instead of materializing the complete input.
- Avoid recalculating the same HMAC more than once in one operation.
- Benchmark HMAC independently from plain hashing because key setup, inner and outer hashing and payload size can change the relative result.

### OTP, Passwords And Randomness

- Preserve the algorithm required by the OTP protocol and provisioning contract.
- HOTP requires the protocol-defined HMAC-SHA-1 construction unless an explicitly compatible extension defines otherwise.
- TOTP may use HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256 or HMAC-SHA-512 when the selected algorithm is consistently provisioned and supported by both generator and verifier.
- Do not automatically replace HMAC-SHA-1 in HOTP or an existing TOTP deployment merely because another algorithm benchmarks faster.
- Treat the moving factor as the exact protocol-defined binary value, not its printable hexadecimal text.
- Decode Base32, hexadecimal or other secret encodings once per operation or once per safely scoped immutable instance.
- Reuse the decoded binary secret inside repeated verification-window checks.
- Keep verification windows and resynchronization ranges no larger than correctness and usability require because each additional candidate requires another HMAC operation.
- Preserve throttling, replay protection, time-step behavior, counter behavior and timing-safe comparison while optimizing OTP throughput.
- Benchmark:
  - HOTP generation,
  - HOTP verification,
  - TOTP generation,
  - TOTP verification,
  - valid and invalid codes,
  - each supported HMAC algorithm,
  - realistic verification windows,
  - and repeated calls inside one request.
- Validate implementations against published protocol test vectors before accepting performance results.

- Do not use fast general-purpose hashes or HMAC as a replacement for password hashing.
- Use `password_hash()` and `password_verify()` or another approved password-hashing API.
- Prefer the project's approved memory-hard password algorithm where available and compatible.
- Tune password-hashing cost separately from general request-path hashing.
- Password hashing is intentionally expensive; do not weaken its cost merely to improve benchmark RPM.
- Capacity-plan authentication endpoints around the selected password-hashing cost.
- Apply rate limiting and abuse controls rather than replacing password hashing with a faster digest.
- For already high-entropy random API tokens, choose storage and verification strategy from the threat model; do not automatically apply password-hashing cost intended for human passwords.
- Never log plaintext passwords, HMAC keys, OTP secrets, raw API tokens or derived secret material.

- Use `random_bytes()` or `random_int()` for security-sensitive random values.
- A default `Random\Randomizer` uses a cryptographically secure engine, but an injected engine may not.
- Do not accept arbitrary random engines for security-sensitive identifiers, tokens, secrets, nonces or cryptographic operations.
- Use deterministic or seedable engines only for tests, simulations, fixtures or explicitly non-security-sensitive behavior.
- Reuse a safely scoped `Random\Randomizer` when repeated operations justify it.
- Do not instantiate random engines repeatedly inside hot loops without measurement.
- Use `Randomizer::getBytesFromString()` only when uniform selection from an explicit byte alphabet satisfies the contract.
- Do not confuse random-looking output with sufficient entropy.
- Calculate entropy from the alphabet size and generated length.

- Do not rely blindly on runtime-default password-hashing cost values because defaults can change between PHP versions.
- Define and benchmark password-hashing policy explicitly for each deployment class.
- For bcrypt, set an intentional cost when stable authentication capacity is required.
- For Argon2, set intentional memory, time and thread parameters where supported.
- Keep password-hashing policy strong enough for the threat model even when authentication RPM is lower.
- Use `password_needs_rehash()` when the selected algorithm or options change.
- Rehash after successful verification rather than through an unbounded bulk operation.
- Include the selected password algorithm and options in authentication capacity tests.
- Treat a runtime upgrade that changes hashing defaults as a capacity-affecting change requiring measurement.

### Cryptographic Benchmarking

- Maintain separate benchmarks for:
  - short scalar payloads,
  - common request-sized payloads,
  - large buffers,
  - streaming input,
  - raw binary output,
  - encoded output,
  - one-shot hashing,
  - repeated hashing,
  - one-shot HMAC,
  - repeated HMAC with the same algorithm and key,
  - file hashing,
  - and end-to-end request throughput.
- Include call overhead and output encoding when they occur in production.
- Benchmark the actual payload-size distribution; large-buffer gigabytes-per-second results may not predict performance for 16-byte, 64-byte or 1-KiB messages.
- Warm the runtime consistently and run enough iterations to separate algorithm cost from timer and function-call noise.
- Confirm every candidate produces the required digest width, encoding and protocol-compatible result.
- Measure collision-handling cost for non-cryptographic hashes where collisions are possible.
- Record algorithm availability with `hash_algos()` and `hash_hmac_algos()` for the supported PHP runtime.
- Do not add runtime algorithm discovery to every request.
- Prefer build-time or startup validation of required algorithms.
- Select the fastest measured algorithm that satisfies the exact security, collision, interoperability and output requirements.

## Database, External Services And Caching

### Database Access And Storage

- Apply these rules to applications, database libraries, query builders, repositories, storage adapters and ORM layers.
- Avoid hidden queries, implicit metadata discovery, unnecessary automatic count queries and per-row object construction.
- Keep connection acquisition, statement preparation, parameter binding, execution and result conversion explicit enough to profile.
- Support prepared-statement reuse, batching, streaming and cursors when they increase complete workload RPM.
- Do not optimize the PHP database layer in a way that overloads the database or lowers total successful RPM.
- Treat query count, rows examined, rows returned, transferred bytes, lock duration and transaction duration as measurable costs.
- Batch inserts, updates, deletes and lookups where correctness permits.
- Select only required columns.
- Avoid loading complete records when only existence, count, aggregate or identifier data is needed.
- Prefer existence checks over full counts when only existence is required.
- Push appropriate filtering, joining, grouping and aggregation to the database.
- Do not transfer excessive data into PHP for work the database can perform efficiently.
- Do not move business rules into SQL when doing so materially harms correctness or maintainability.
- Verify important queries with execution-plan tooling such as `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
- Test plans using representative data volume and distribution.
- Do not infer production behavior from a small development dataset.
- Add indexes based on actual predicates, joins ordering, uniqueness requirements and measured query plans.
- Do not add speculative indexes.
- Account for index storage and write amplification.
- Avoid functions, casts and transformations on indexed columns when they prevent useful index access.
- Keep transactions as short as correctness permits.
- Avoid network calls, file operations, user interaction or slow computation inside transactions.
- Establish a consistent lock order when multiple resources are updated.
- Use keyset or cursor pagination for large or frequently changing datasets where offset pagination becomes costly or inconsistent.
- Use offset pagination when datasets are bounded and simplicity is the better trade-off.
- Choose buffered or unbuffered query modes deliberately.
- Account for connection occupancy and driver limitations with unbuffered results.
- Keep bulk operations within safe parameter, packet, lock and transaction-size limits.
- Avoid exact total-count queries when the caller does not require an exact total.

**PDO And Database-Extension Compatibility**

- Prefer driver-specific PDO subclasses on supported runtimes when driver-specific constants or methods are required.
- Keep portable behavior on standard PDO contracts and isolate genuinely driver-specific behavior.
- Do not call driver-specific APIs through the base `PDO` class when the supported runtime provides a driver-specific class.
- Treat database extensions, native clients and driver versions as explicit deployment dependencies.
- Declare, install and verify required database extensions.
- Include PDO driver, native client and server versions in reproducible benchmark evidence.

### External I/O And Concurrency

- Set explicit connection, read, write and total-operation timeouts for external dependencies.
- Do not allow a slow dependency to consume request or worker capacity indefinitely.
- Batch independent remote operations when supported.
- Use bounded concurrency when it improves latency and the runtime supports it safely.
- Never introduce unbounded parallelism.
- Respect downstream connection pools, rate limits, quotas and backpressure.
- Retry only operations that are safe to retry.
- Keep retry counts bounded.
- Use appropriate delay and jitter.
- Make retried write operations idempotent or protect them with an idempotency mechanism.
- Do not retry deterministic validation, authorization or permanent client errors.
- Avoid retry multiplication across multiple infrastructure layers.
- Use queues, deferred processing, circuit breaking or load shedding only when they meaningfully reduce latency or cascading failure.
- Do not introduce asynchronous processing when synchronous execution already meets latency and reliability requirements.

**Attached Resources And Service Boundaries**

- Treat databases, caches, queues, object storage, SMTP providers and external APIs as attached resources.
- Access each resource through explicit configuration, credentials and resource handles.
- Do not hard-code whether a resource is local, self-managed, cloud-managed or third-party.
- Allow a compatible resource instance to be replaced through configuration without changing business logic.
- Treat each resource as having independent:
  - health state,
  - timeouts,
  - rate limits,
  - connection limits,
  - metrics,
  - and capacity budgets.
- Do not silently fall back from a required shared resource to process memory or local disk when correctness or cross-worker behavior changes.
- Keep provider-specific behavior behind a boundary only when substitution is a real operational requirement.
- Do not hide important transactional, consistency, latency or capability differences behind a generic abstraction.
- Include backing-service latency and saturation in sustained RPM tests.

**HTTP Client Interoperability**

- Use PSR-18 `ClientInterface` at reusable outbound HTTP boundaries where the caller must select the client implementation.
- Use the narrow PSR-17 request, URI and stream factories required to construct PSR-7 requests without coupling to one implementation.
- Reusable libraries should depend on the PSR interfaces rather than a concrete HTTP client when interoperability is part of the contract.
- Applications may use a concrete client directly when no substitution boundary exists and the simpler design is preferable.
- Do not assume PSR-18 throws for HTTP `4xx` or `5xx` responses; inspect response status explicitly.
- Treat PSR-18 client and network exceptions according to their defined interfaces.
- Keep timeout, retry, redirect, authentication and circuit-breaking policy in the appropriate integration layer.
- Do not assume PSR-18 provides asynchronous or concurrent requests.
- Use implementation-specific asynchronous APIs only behind an explicit boundary and only when measured throughput justifies them.
- Avoid converting request and response objects between several HTTP abstractions.
- Apply adapters once at the boundary and benchmark their effect on sustained RPM.

### Caching

- Add caching only after identifying a meaningful repeated cost.
- Cache the smallest stable result at the most appropriate layer.
- Define cache keys, scope, ownership, expiration, invalidation and versioning explicitly.
- Do not treat cache invalidation as an implementation detail.
- Prevent cache stampedes for expensive or highly shared entries.
- Use bounded cache sizes and appropriate TTLs.
- Avoid indefinite process-local caches in long-running workers unless growth is strictly bounded.
- Do not cache authorization decisions, secrets, failures, empty results or user-specific data without considering security and staleness.
- Do not use caching to conceal inefficient queries or broken access patterns.
- Measure cache hit rate, miss cost, latency, memory use and invalidation behavior.
- Ensure the system remains correct when the cache is cold, unavailable, stale or cleared.

**Cache Interoperability**

- Use PSR-16 `Psr\SimpleCache\CacheInterface` for simple key/value caching when its `null`-on-miss semantics are acceptable.
- Use PSR-6 `Psr\Cache\CacheItemPoolInterface` when the contract needs explicit hit detection, cache items, deferred saves or richer pool semantics.
- Do not depend on both PSR-6 and PSR-16 unless the package intentionally supports both contracts.
- Do not add a PSR cache dependency when caching is entirely internal and no implementation substitution is required.
- Reusable cache-aware libraries should accept a PSR cache interface from the caller rather than instantiate a concrete cache provider.
- Applications must provide and configure the actual cache implementation.
- With PSR-16, do not cache `null` when the caller must distinguish a stored `null` from a miss unless an explicit sentinel or envelope is used.
- With PSR-6, call `isHit()` when a cached `null` value must be distinguished from a miss.
- Use multi-key methods when they reduce network round trips and preserve semantics.
- For PSR-6 deferred writes, call `commit()` at an explicit safe boundary; do not rely solely on destructors for critical persistence.
- Keep keys compatible with the selected PSR and backing store.
- Avoid layered PSR-6/PSR-16 adapters in hot paths unless interoperability value outweighs conversion cost.
- Benchmark direct provider access and PSR adapter access when cache calls dominate request throughput.

## Events, Logging And Observability

### Events And Extension Points

- Use direct method calls for required synchronous behavior when the caller knows the collaborator.
- Use PSR-14 when a reusable package or application exposes a genuine interoperable event-dispatch boundary.
- Do not introduce events merely to avoid an explicit dependency or direct call.
- Keep event objects immutable when listeners only need notification.
- Allow controlled mutation only when listeners are intentionally expected to contribute information back to the emitter.
- Treat PSR-14 dispatch as synchronous.
- Do not assume listener return values are used.
- Allow listener failures to propagate according to the PSR-14 contract unless an explicit boundary converts or records them and rethrows appropriately.
- Use stoppable events only when early termination is a real part of the contract.
- Do not hide mandatory authorization, validation, transaction or persistence flow behind optional listeners.
- Compile listener mappings before runtime when possible.
- Avoid reflection-based listener discovery on every request.
- Keep listener order explicit when behavior depends on ordering.
- Do not emit high-volume events inside hot loops without representative throughput measurements.
- Queue or defer listener work only when the result is not required by the emitter and delivery semantics are explicitly defined.
- Measure dispatcher, listener-provider and listener costs as part of end-to-end RPM.

### Logging And Diagnostic Cost

- Avoid expensive debug formatting when the corresponding log level is disabled.
- Do not log complete large payloads, binary data, secrets, credentials, tokens or sensitive information.
- Use structured logs with bounded field sizes.
- Include a release, build or commit identifier in logs and metrics when available.
- Sample high-volume diagnostic events where full capture is unnecessary.
- Keep logging, tracing and metrics lightweight on hot paths.
- Record durations, query counts, external calls, failures and relevant payload sizes where they aid diagnosis.

**Logs As Event Streams**

- Treat logs as event streams rather than application-managed files.
- Write normal process output to `stdout` and errors to `stderr` when the execution environment captures those streams.
- Do not make application code responsible for log rotation, retention, routing, compression or archival.
- Let the execution environment route and retain logs.
- Include stable fields where available:
  - timestamp,
  - severity,
  - event name,
  - release or build identifier,
  - process type,
  - request or correlation identifier,
  - and bounded relevant context.
- Avoid synchronous remote log transport in request paths.
- Do not suppress errors solely to improve benchmark throughput.
- Use the logging platform for aggregation, searching, alerting and RPM/error analysis.

**Logging Interoperability**

- Use PSR-3 `LoggerInterface` at reusable package and infrastructure boundaries when caller-controlled logging is useful.
- Libraries should accept a caller-provided logger, remain logging-agnostic or use an explicitly configured no-op logger.
- Do not instantiate or configure a concrete logging backend inside a reusable library.
- Use stable message templates and place variable data in the context array.
- Put a caught `Throwable` in the `exception` context key when the logger should record it.
- Keep context values tolerant of mixed types and bounded in size.
- Do not construct expensive context merely because a `NullLogger` or disabled backend will discard it.
- Guard expensive diagnostic context generation or expose lazy caller-controlled diagnostics.
- Do not log once per item in large loops unless the operational requirement outweighs the RPM cost.
- When adapting a framework logger to PSR-3, perform the adaptation once rather than wrapping every log call.
- Select a `psr/log` package major version compatible with the project's PHP baseline and logger implementation.

## Dependencies, Configuration And Code Loading

### Composer, Dependencies And Autoloading

- Use Composer autoloading instead of manual class includes.
- Use PSR-4-compatible, case-correct namespaces and paths.
- Treat path and casing violations as build failures.
- Use paths anchored with `__DIR__` for required non-class files.
- Avoid current-working-directory-dependent loading.
- Avoid mutable `include_path` behavior.
- Avoid request-derived or uncontrolled include paths.
- Do not repeatedly call `file_exists()`, `is_file()` or `is_readable()` before loading known application classes.
- Avoid recursive directory scanning, reflection discovery and filesystem registration in production request paths.
- Perform discovery during build, deployment or cache-generation stages.
- Generate Composer’s optimized classmap for every production build:

```bash
composer install \
    --no-dev \
    --prefer-dist \
    --optimize-autoloader \
    --no-interaction
```

- Use authoritative classmaps when the complete production class set is known at deployment time.
- Do not enable authoritative classmaps when the application or a dependency legitimately generates classes dynamically.
- When authoritative mode is unsuitable, retain optimized classmaps and consider APCu autoload-miss caching only after measurement.
- Do not combine authoritative classmap mode with APCu autoload optimization.
- Rebuild the production autoloader whenever source files or dependencies change.
- Never generate Composer autoload metadata during a web request.

**Dependency Declaration And Isolation**

- Declare PHP dependencies explicitly in `composer.json`.
- Commit `composer.lock` for deployable applications.
- For reusable libraries, define compatible dependency ranges deliberately and test the supported range.
- Declare required PHP versions and extensions through Composer platform requirements where practical.
- Do not rely on globally installed packages, incidental `include_path` entries, undeclared extensions or developer-machine tools.
- Treat external executables and system libraries as explicit dependencies.
- Declare, package or provision required system tools and compatible versions.
- Fail build or startup validation clearly when a required dependency is unavailable.
- Exclude development-only dependencies from production release artifacts.
- Do not add request-path dependency-isolation wrappers when build and process isolation solve the requirement.

**Interoperability Package Dependencies**

- A reusable consumer library should require only the PSR interface packages it actually uses.
- Do not require a concrete PSR implementation from a reusable consumer library unless the implementation is an intentional part of its contract.
- A deployable application must install and configure concrete implementations for every consumed PSR contract.
- A package that implements a PSR should declare the appropriate implementation capability through Composer when the ecosystem contract defines one.
- Keep PSR package major versions compatible with the project's supported PHP versions and the selected implementation.
- Do not install PSR packages speculatively.
- Avoid adapter packages that convert among several equivalent contracts unless integration requirements justify the added calls and allocations.
- Test public interoperability against at least one independent implementation when the package claims framework-agnostic support.

### Configuration And Generated Metadata

- Compile stable configuration, routes, dependency mappings, event mappings, serializer metadata and similar discovery-heavy structures during build or deployment.
- Prefer deterministic generated PHP files over reparsing YAML, XML, JSON, `.env`, annotations or directory structures on every request.
- Do not parse `.env` files in production request paths.
- Load production configuration from the process environment or deployment-generated immutable configuration.
- Do not regenerate compiled metadata from a normal application request.
- Version generated metadata with the application release.
- Write generated files atomically before exposing them to workers.
- Validate generated PHP files before activating a release.

**Deploy Configuration And Secrets**

- Keep configuration that varies between deploys outside the codebase.
- Inject database, cache, queue, service, hostname, credential, feature-control and per-deploy settings through environment variables or an equivalent deployment-controlled mechanism.
- Never commit secrets, private keys, OTP seeds, HMAC keys, credentials or production resource locators.
- Keep non-varying internal configuration in version-controlled code or build-generated immutable metadata.
- Prefer granular configuration values over scattered conditionals based on broad names such as `development`, `staging` or `production`.
- Validate and normalize required configuration once during build validation, startup or bootstrap.
- Reuse the immutable normalized result.
- Do not repeatedly read `getenv()`, `$_ENV`, secret stores or config parsers inside hot paths.
- Reusable libraries should receive deploy-varying configuration from callers unless environment loading is their explicit responsibility.
- Keep sensitive configuration out of logs, exceptions, diagnostics and benchmark output.
- Design the repository so it can be published without revealing deploy credentials.

### OPcache-Friendly Loading And Filesystem Resolution

- Write PHP that can be loaded from stable, deterministic files and reused unchanged across requests.
- Treat OPcache compatibility as part of code structure, autoloading, build generation and deployment design.
- Do not distort clear architecture for speculative OPcache micro-optimizations.
- Avoid `eval()`, runtime source generation and dynamically generated PHP classes unless technically necessary and measured.
- Do not generate, rewrite or modify application PHP source files during normal request processing.
- Keep deployed PHP source immutable for the lifetime of a release.

- Use stable, canonical paths.
- Size PHP’s realpath cache according to actual file and path usage.
- Use longer realpath cache TTLs only with immutable or rarely changing deployments.
- Account for security settings that disable realpath caching.
- Do not weaken required security boundaries merely to enable path caching.
- Avoid unnecessary repeated filesystem checks even when realpath caching is enabled.

## Runtime Processes, Deployment And Operations

### Runtime Model And Process Management

- Choose the PHP runtime model by measured sustained successful RPM, not convention.
- Benchmark supported execution models where relevant, including:
  - PHP-FPM,
  - persistent-worker application servers,
  - and other production-supported SAPIs.
- Prefer the execution model with the highest stable successful RPM for the representative workload.
- Persistent workers may remove repeated bootstrap and autoload cost, but use them only when:
  - request-specific state is reliably reset,
  - memory growth is bounded,
  - services do not retain tenant or user state,
  - database and network resources are managed safely,
  - and soak tests confirm stability.
- Do not adopt persistent workers solely because a synthetic Hello World benchmark is faster.
- Size worker and process counts from a measured throughput curve.
- Increase concurrency until throughput stops improving or errors, queueing, context switching, database pressure or tail latency rise materially.
- Do not assume one worker per CPU core is universally optimal.
- Align PHP worker capacity with:
  - database connection limits,
  - cache connections,
  - external-service limits,
  - available memory,
  - and CPU saturation.
- Prefer connection reuse and keep-alive where they improve RPM and remain operationally safe.
- Avoid excessive persistent connections that reduce database availability or worker density.
- Offload static files and large immutable assets from PHP when a web server or CDN can serve them more efficiently.
- Apply response compression only when its network savings improve end-to-end RPM.
- Use queues for work that is not required to complete the response when deferral materially increases request throughput and preserves correctness.
- Keep request handlers free from non-essential background work.

**Stateless And Share-Nothing Processes**

- Design web and worker processes so correctness does not depend on memory or local filesystem state surviving a request, restart or reschedule.
- Persist durable state in appropriate backing services.
- Treat process memory and local filesystem storage as ephemeral.
- Allow process-local caches only when correctness does not depend on future hits, entries are bounded and any process may handle the next request.
- Do not rely on sticky sessions.
- Store shared session state in a shared backing service.
- Do not store uploads, exports or business records only on a worker's local filesystem.
- Persistent workers must reset request-, tenant- and user-specific state after every request.
- Test worker replacement, process restart and multi-worker routing.

**Service Endpoints And Port Binding**

- Bind self-contained services to an explicitly configured host, port or socket.
- Do not hard-code listening ports, public hostnames, TLS termination or routing topology.
- For PHP-FPM, treat the configured FastCGI socket or port as the process endpoint and keep the web server separately deployable.
- Do not force reusable libraries to open or manage listening ports.
- Keep health and readiness endpoints inexpensive and free of sensitive topology details.

**Process Types And Concurrency**

- Represent workloads with different scaling, latency, resource or failure characteristics as explicit process types.
- Separate web request handling from long-running background work when synchronous completion is not required.
- Scale horizontally through stateless process instances when measured capacity requires it.
- Size web workers, queue consumers, schedulers and administrative processes independently.
- Keep concurrency bounded by database, cache, queue and downstream capacity.
- Do not daemonize or manage PID files inside application code when a process manager, container runtime or orchestrator owns lifecycle.
- Let the process manager capture output, restart crashes and coordinate shutdown.
- Internal asynchronous concurrency is allowed when it increases sustained successful RPM and remains bounded and observable.
- Do not use process proliferation to conceal a downstream bottleneck.

**Disposability And Graceful Shutdown**

- Keep startup fast enough for deployment, recovery and horizontal scaling.
- Move expensive deterministic preparation into build or release stages.
- Handle termination signals and stop accepting new work before shutdown where supported.
- Allow bounded in-flight completion.
- Acknowledge only completed jobs and return unfinished work or leases safely.
- Design jobs to be idempotent or reentrant because termination can occur after partial execution.
- Assume sudden death can bypass destructors, shutdown handlers and `finally` blocks.
- Protect durable operations with transactions, idempotency keys, leases, checkpoints or deduplication.
- Test graceful shutdown, abrupt death and simultaneous worker startup.

**Runtime Limits And Diagnostics**

- Keep per-process memory limits aligned with worker count, container limits and required worker density.
- On supported runtimes, use `max_memory_limit` as an administrator-controlled ceiling when application code must not raise or disable its memory limit.
- Do not use `ini_set('memory_limit', '-1')` as a general performance tactic.
- Do not expose `phpinfo()` or unrestricted runtime configuration publicly.
- Record whether PHP is:
  - thread-safe or non-thread-safe,
  - debug or production built,
  - using JIT,
  - and using the intended OPcache configuration.

### Build, Release And Deployment

- Prefer immutable, versioned releases and atomic activation.
- Never partially overwrite PHP files that may be read concurrently.
- Complete dependency installation, autoloader generation, metadata compilation, validation and tests before activating a release.
- When timestamp validation is disabled, make OPcache refresh an explicit deployment step.
- Refresh OPcache through a controlled PHP-FPM reload, process restart or correctly scoped invalidation.
- Do not assume changed files will become visible when timestamp validation is disabled.
- Do not expose unrestricted OPcache reset or status endpoints publicly.
- Restrict cache controls to trusted deployment or administrative paths.
- Reduce file-update protection only when all PHP file updates are guaranteed to be atomic.
- Roll back by activating a complete previous release, not by restoring individual files inside the active release.

**Codebase And Release Identity**

- Keep each independently deployable application or service associated with one version-controlled codebase.
- Use the same codebase across development, staging and production; deploys may run different committed versions.
- Treat independently deployable components as separate applications with explicit contracts.
- Move genuinely shared code into versioned Composer packages instead of copying source between applications.
- Identify every release by an immutable commit, tag, build ID or release ID.
- Keep generated artifacts traceable to the source revision that produced them.

**Build, Release And Run Separation**

- Separate deployment into build, release and run stages.
- Build should:
  - install dependencies,
  - optimize Composer metadata,
  - compile stable routes, configuration and metadata,
  - build assets,
  - run validation,
  - and produce an immutable artifact.
- Release should combine an immutable build with deploy-specific configuration and assign a unique release ID.
- Run should start an existing release with as few moving parts as practical.
- Do not download code, update packages, discover dependencies, generate classes, compile source or mutate application files during normal requests.
- Treat releases as append-only and immutable.
- Any code, dependency or build-artifact change must produce a new release.
- Roll back by activating a complete previous release rather than patching live files.
- Verify release configuration and required resource connectivity before shifting traffic where practical.

### OPcache Capacity, Warm-Up And Observability

- Enable OPcache in production and verify it is active for the intended SAPI.
- Size OPcache from observed usage, not copied configuration.
- Size:
  - `opcache.memory_consumption`,
  - `opcache.max_accelerated_files`,
  - and `opcache.interned_strings_buffer`
  using measured application requirements.
- Keep sufficient headroom to prevent cache exhaustion and frequent restarts.
- Keep `opcache.max_file_size=0` unless excluding large files is supported by measurement.
- Retain safe optimizer passes.
- Do not enable undocumented or unsafe optimizer flags.
- Keep `opcache.save_comments=1` unless the complete dependency set is verified not to use runtime doc comments.
- Do not disable comments for an assumed memory improvement.
- Do not disable `opcache.use_cwd` unless path uniqueness and application isolation are guaranteed.
- Consider controlled warm-up when cold-start latency is operationally significant.
- Warm representative frequently used code, not every file blindly.
- Compare warm-up cost against the first-request and sustained-RPM benefit.
- Avoid warm-up stampedes when several workers start together.
- Do not call `opcache_compile_file()` from normal request paths.
- Treat preloading as optional and workload-dependent.
- Preload only stable, frequently used code after measurement.
- Require a process restart when preloaded code changes.
- Treat JIT separately from OPcache and enable it only when representative benchmarks show meaningful benefit.

- Monitor OPcache rather than assuming it is effective.
- Track:
  - cache hit rate,
  - cached and uncached script counts,
  - used and free shared memory,
  - interned-string usage,
  - wasted memory,
  - cache-full status,
  - out-of-memory restarts,
  - hash-table restarts,
  - and manual restarts.
- Alert on recurring exhaustion, frequent restarts or sustained hit-rate degradation.
- Verify after deployment that expected application and Composer files are cacheable.
- Compare cold and warm request performance separately.
- Do not claim an OPcache improvement based only on configuration changes.

### Development And Production Parity

- Keep development, test, staging and production as similar as practical in:
  - PHP major and minor version,
  - required extensions,
  - Composer install mode,
  - runtime model,
  - OPcache behavior,
  - operating-system assumptions,
  - database type and major version,
  - cache and queue technology,
  - serialization formats,
  - and critical configuration semantics.
- Avoid lightweight local substitutes when behavioral differences can hide production defects.
- Use reproducible environments or declarative provisioning to reduce drift.
- Keep the time between verified change and deployment short enough to limit divergence.
- Test performance-sensitive code with production-equivalent PHP, Composer and OPcache settings.
- Test database behavior with representative production-like volume and distribution.
- Document unavoidable differences and test the affected boundaries.
- Keep developers close to deployment and production observability for the code they change.

### Administrative And One-Off Processes

- Run migrations, repair scripts, backfills, consoles and maintenance tasks as explicit one-off processes.
- Execute them against the same immutable release, dependency set and deploy configuration as regular processes.
- Keep administrative scripts version-controlled.
- Do not edit production code interactively or maintain untracked production-only scripts.
- Make administrative commands:
  - access-controlled,
  - auditable,
  - observable,
  - resumable where practical,
  - and safely rerunnable where feasible.
- Use bounded batches, checkpoints, transactions and idempotency for large changes.
- Do not let one-off tasks monopolize database connections, locks, CPU, memory or queue capacity required by request-serving processes.
- Benchmark or rate-limit heavy backfills when they can reduce production RPM.
- Require dry-run support or explicit confirmation for destructive operations.

## Tooling And Workflow

- Respect repository tooling and quality checks such as formatting, static analysis, refactoring, tests, mutation testing, profiling and benchmarks.
- Use the project’s existing automation instead of manually enforcing style.
- Configure automated formatting for the declared PER Coding Style or established repository standard.
- Keep formatting checks separate from semantic and performance validation.
- Use static analysis at the strongest practical level supported by the project.
- Run compatibility and deprecation checks against every supported PHP version and the next intended upgrade target.
- Add or update tests for affected behavior, boundaries, failures and contracts.
- Add benchmarks only for meaningful, stable, performance-sensitive behavior.
- After implementation or function/method documentation work, use the automation and workflow described in [AGENTS.md](vendor\infocyph\phpforge\resources\AGENTS.md) if exists.
- Review automated changes for correctness.
- Keep automated changes within scope.
- Do not accept generated or automated refactoring without reviewing the resulting behavior.
- Report which formatting, analysis, tests, profiling and benchmarks were run.
- Clearly state anything that could not be verified.
